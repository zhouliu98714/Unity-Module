* Introduction

This is a code designed to render infinite object rotation


* Requirements
Needs to be placed inside player object, along with Mesh Renderer, Rigidbody, and Box collider. 


* Future Implementation
Will consider implementing finite rotation under a given amount of time or requirements.



* Note
This is only a little spice up twist for objects on display, cannot be used along with objects available for pick up as the internal physics setting would me messed up
