* Introduction

This is a code designed to render player controls, including but are not limited to (will be implemented further in the future) basic movements, jumping, and currently flying due to the failure of constraint to the ground.


* Requirements
Needs to be placed inside player object, along with Mesh Renderer, Rigidbody, and Sphere collider. 
Make sure to match the public variable "Ground Layer" in this code with the layer of the player object!

*** will be fixed in the future, currently a failure" 

As of now, sticks with the camera+character controller+ first person camera setting.
